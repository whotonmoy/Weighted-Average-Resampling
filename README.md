# Weighted-Average-Resampling
Grayscale Image Resizing using Weighted Average Resampling

It is a program that reads a grayscale image in raw format from a file; resize the image to a specified resolution using the weighted average resampling method; and save the new image into a new file in raw format. 

The program has been tested with the following data:

a) Input image filename: “rose.raw”
 Format: grayscale
 Original resolution: 256x256
 New resolution: 500x500

b) Input image filename: “rose.raw”
 Format: grayscale
 Original resolution: 256x256
 New resolution: 1000x1000

c) Input image filename: “museum.raw”
 Format: grayscale
 Original resolution: 1280x960
 New resolution: 640x480

d) Input image filename: “museum.raw”
 Format: grayscale
 Original resolution: 1280x960
 New resolution: 320x240

e) Input image filename: “museum.raw”
 Format: grayscale
 Original resolution: 1280x960
 New resolution: 160x120


This was an assignment that I did in my second to last semester(Winter 2023) for Image Processing Course (CS 425).
